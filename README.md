Hydrascale lets one Linux host join several Tailscale tailnets at the same time. It is for
the operator who administers a host that must reach a work tailnet, a home tailnet, and a
customer tailnet at once. The daemon holds each tailnet in its own network namespace, it
enforces the reachability rules that the operator declares, and it serves a console on the
loopback address.

## What Hydrascale does

Hydrascale creates one network namespace per tailnet and runs a separate `tailscaled`
inside each. Traffic of one tailnet stays inside its own network stack. Overlapping IP
ranges, independent firewall rules, and separate routing tables therefore work without an
extra step.

The operator declares the tailnets in a YAML configuration file. The reconciler drives the
live host toward that file. Add a tailnet to the file and the daemon creates it. Remove a
tailnet and the daemon deletes the namespace, stops the process, and removes the routes. A
unified DNS resolver answers names across every tailnet, so the host reaches a peer by
name.

The reconciler runs as a control loop. On each tick it reads the configuration, reads the
live host, computes the difference, and applies the smallest set of actions. A tailnet that
fails three times in a row enters an error state, and the reconciler skips it until the
operator resets it. One broken tailnet therefore stops no other tailnet. The event log
records every action.

Version 1.0 adds three things to that loop:

- **The console.** The daemon serves a web interface on `127.0.0.1:9443`. The console shows
  the namespaces, the local rules, the upstream policy, and the event list.
- **Local rules.** The daemon enforces a declared rule set on the host with iptables. A
  path that no rule allows is denied.
- **Upstream policy.** The daemon reads, validates, and writes the access-control document
  that the control server of a tailnet holds.

## Requirements

- **Linux.** A network namespace is a Linux kernel feature.
- **Go 1.26 or later**, to build from source.
- **Root, or the capability `CAP_NET_ADMIN`.**
- **Tailscale.** The commands `tailscaled` and `tailscale` must be in `$PATH`.
- **iproute2.** The daemon runs `ip` to manage a namespace.
- **iptables.** The daemon writes the NAT rules and the forward rules.
- **Kernel network namespace support** (`CONFIG_NET_NS`), which every current kernel holds.
- **Kernel policy routing** (`CONFIG_IP_MULTIPLE_TABLES`, `CONFIG_IPV6_MULTIPLE_TABLES`).
  [Host access](#host-access) needs it to propagate an accepted subnet route to the host.
  Most distribution kernels hold it. Some single-board kernels omit it, and route
  propagation then changes nothing.
- **IP forwarding.** Run `sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`.

## Install

### A released binary

Download a binary from the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Crank-Git/Hydrascale/releases) page:

```bash
tar xzf hydrascale_*.tar.gz
sudo install hydrascale /usr/local/bin/
```

### A build from source

```bash
go install hydrascale/cmd/hydrascale@latest
```

Or clone the repository and build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Crank-Git/Hydrascale.git
cd hydrascale
go build -o hydrascale ./cmd/hydrascale
sudo install hydrascale /usr/local/bin/
```

## Quick start

The interactive wizard is the shortest path. It runs the preflight checks, writes the
configuration, sets up the authentication, starts the first tailnet, and confirms that the
tailnet authenticated:

```bash
sudo hydrascale init
```

To configure the host by hand instead:

1. Write a configuration file at `/etc/hydrascale/config.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 2
tailnets:
  - id: corp-prod
  - id: homelab
    exit_node: exit-us.example.com
access:
  mode: enforce
  rules:
    - from: corp-prod
      to: internet
    - from: homelab
      to: internet
resolver:
  mode: unified
reconciler:
  interval: 10s
```

2. Apply the configuration once:

```bash
sudo hydrascale apply
```

3. Or run the daemon, which reconciles on every tick:

```bash
sudo hydrascale serve
```

4. Open the console at `http://127.0.0.1:9443`.

5. Read the state:

```bash
sudo hydrascale status
```

A tailnet needs about 20 seconds after a start of the daemon before `hydrascale status`
reports `healthy` and `running`. An earlier read reports `down` and `degraded`, which is a
normal state after a start. A tailnet that still reports `down` after 60 seconds has a
real failure.

## The console

The daemon serves the console on the loopback address. The console is a static single-page
application inside the binary, so it makes no request to another host and it needs no build
step. It holds six views: Overview, Namespaces, Access, Policy, Activity, and Settings.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/console-namespaces.png" alt="The Namespaces view of the console. One row per tailnet states the health, the reachability, the peer count, the address, and the namespace name." width="900">
</p>

<p align="center"><i>The Namespaces view. One row per tailnet. The names and the addresses are placeholders.</i></p>

The daemon serves the console when the configuration file holds no `console` key, so a
version 0.9 file needs no edit. The default address is `127.0.0.1:9443`:

```yaml
console:
  enabled: true                  # default: true
  bind_address: "127.0.0.1:9443" # default: 127.0.0.1:9443
```

The daemon serves the JSON API on the console listener as well as on the control socket.

To confirm the listener, read the status code:

```bash
curl -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:9443/    # prints 200
```

The daemon writes the address and the authentication position to the log at every start:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u hydrascale | grep 'the console listens on'
```

### The console has no authentication

**Warning — the console has no sign-in, and the daemon runs as root.** Any local account on
the host reaches `http://127.0.0.1:9443` and drives the daemon. The operator accepted this
risk for version 1.0. Give a local account on this host the trust that root needs.

Four controls reduce the risk:

1. The listener binds a loopback address only. The daemon refuses any other address, it
   writes the reason to the log, and `hydrascale apply` refuses the same value.
2. Every mutating route requires the header `X-Hydrascale-Console: 1`. A browser sets no
   custom header on a cross-origin form post.
3. The daemon answers HTTP 403 when the `Origin` header names another origin.
4. The daemon records one event for every mutating request, and the Activity view shows it.

Control 2 and control 3 stop a hostile web page. Neither control stops a local account.

To close the listener, set `console.enabled: false`. The control socket keeps serving the
JSON API.

## Local rules

A local rule is one reachability rule that the daemon enforces on the host with iptables.
The daemon owns the chains `HYDRASCALE-FWD` and `HYDRASCALE-OUT`, and one jump rule into
each of `FORWARD` and `INPUT`. It writes no other rule, and it moves no rule of the
operator.

The rule set holds no deny rule, because deny is the default. A path that no rule allows is
denied.

```yaml
access:
  mode: enforce        # default: enforce. The other mode is observe.
  rules:
    - from: corp-prod
      to: internet     # every port and both protocols
    - from: host
      to: corp-prod
      ports: ["tcp/22", "tcp/443"]
    - from: homelab
      to: corp-prod
      ports: ["udp/1-1024"]
```

- `from` names a tailnet that the file declares, or the literal `host`. It never names
  `internet`.
- `to` names a tailnet that the file declares, or the literal `host`, or the literal
  `internet`.
- `from` and `to` must differ.
- `ports` holds entries of the form `tcp/<n>`, `udp/<n>`, `tcp/<n>-<m>`, or `udp/<n>-<m>`.
  A port number is between 1 and 65535. An empty list allows every port and both protocols.

The daemon validates the whole block before it writes a rule. A rule that names an unknown
tailnet stops the load, and the error names every failure together.

### The two modes

`enforce` drops a packet that no rule allows. `observe` writes a kernel log line for that
packet and then accepts it.

The tail of each daemon chain accepts in the mode `observe`, therefore the mode drops no
packet of a namespace. A packet that the tail accepts reaches no later chain, and
`ts-forward`, `DOCKER-USER` and `DOCKER-FORWARD` do not see it.

Read the lines of the mode `observe` with:

```bash
journalctl -u hydrascale | grep hydrascale-would-deny
```

The mode `observe` rate-limits the log to 60 packets each minute.

**Warning — a first start on a host with no `access` key changes reachability.** When the
configuration file holds no `access` key, the daemon writes one. It copies the file to
`<config>.pre-v1.backup` first. The rule set it writes holds one rule per tailnet, from that
tailnet to `internet`, in the mode `enforce`. No tailnet reaches another tailnet, and the
host reaches no tailnet.

**Warning — an `access` block that the operator writes by hand suppresses the migration.**
The daemon detects the migration by the presence of the `access` key. That operator
therefore gets no preserving rule set and no copy at `<config>.pre-v1.backup`. To start
version 1.0 in the mode `observe`, write `mode: observe` and one rule per tailnet to
`internet` together. [docs/UPGRADING.md](docs/UPGRADING.md), section "To upgrade with no
enforcement at all", holds that order and the steps after it.

The Access view of the console shows the rule set, stages an edit, and applies it. The
reconciler writes the changed rule set on the next tick.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/console-access.png" alt="The Access view of the console. A dotted curve joins each tailnet to the internet node, a reachability matrix marks the two allowed paths, and the rule list holds one row per rule." width="900">
</p>

<p align="center"><i>The Access view. A filled square and a drawn curve each mark an allowed path. A denied path has neither.</i></p>

## Upstream policy

A policy is the huJSON access-control document that a control server holds for a tailnet.
The Policy view of the console reads that document, validates it, and writes it back. This
is the upstream half of reachability; the local rules are the half that this host enforces.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/console-policy.png" alt="The Policy view of the console. Each tailnet card reports no credential, and the panel asks the operator to select a tailnet." width="900">
</p>

<p align="center"><i>The Policy view before a credential is set. Each card states the exact keys that a policy read needs.</i></p>

The daemon takes the control server kind from the control URL of the tailnet. A tailnet
that declares no `control_url` is a Tailscale tailnet. Every other tailnet is a Headscale
tailnet.

The daemon sends the document to the validate route of the control server before it writes.
A document that validate rejects returns HTTP 400 with the answer of the control server,
and the write route receives no request.

A Tailscale write carries the `ETag` value of the read in the `If-Match` header. When the
policy changed between the read and the write, the control server answers HTTP 412 and the
console reports a conflict. The console re-reads the document and keeps the text of the
operator, so that the operator compares the two.

**A Headscale control server needs `policy.mode: "database"` for a policy write.** A server
that runs the file policy mode rejects `PUT /api/v1/policy`, and the daemon returns the
message of the control server word for word:

```json
{"code":2,"message":"update is disabled for modes other than 'database'","details":[]}
```

`hscontrol/types/config.go:54` of the Headscale source at tag `v0.29.3` declares the two
values:

```go
PolicyModeDB   = "database"
PolicyModeFile = "file"
```

Policy access also needs Headscale v0.29 or later, because an older server exposes no
policy route.

## The Visual policy editor

The Policy view offers a second way to read and change the policy document: the
**Visual** tab, next to **Text**. The Visual tab shows the document as sections, and it
stages an edit to one section at a time. Text stays the way to read or change a section
that Visual does not yet build.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/manual/screenshots/visual-acl-editor/03-visual-tab-rules.png" alt="The section nav of the Visual editor, with ten sections and their entry counts, and the Rules section open below it." width="900">
</p>

<p align="center"><i>The section nav. Rules opens by default, next to a reachability matrix.</i></p>

The section nav lists ten sections, each with a count of the entries it holds:

- **Groups**, **Hosts**, **Tag owners**, and **IP sets** hold the named sets that a
  rule refers to.
- **Rules** holds the reachability matrix and the rule list. A filled square in the
  matrix marks an allowed path, in the same visual language as the Access view.
- **SSH access** holds the rules that grant or check an SSH connection, each with a
  source, a destination, a user list, and an action.
- **Auto-approvers** holds the routes and the exit node that the control server
  approves without an operator step.
- **Node attributes** holds the `nodeAttrs` entries of the document, each with a
  target list and an attribute list.
- **Postures** holds the device posture definitions that a check rule refers to.
- **Tests** holds the assertions that the document declares. A **Run** button sends
  the staged document to the validate route of the control server, and each row shows
  its result as a state dot and a word.

`docs/manual/policy-visual-editor.md` walks each section in order, with a screenshot
per step.

## Credentials

A credential authenticates the daemon to a control server. A policy read and a policy write
need one. The daemon reads a credential at the moment it needs one and holds none between
requests.

A credential never enters the configuration file, never reaches the log, and never reaches
a control API answer. It lives in the secrets file, which the key `secrets_file` names. The
default path is `/etc/hydrascale/secrets.yaml`. The daemon refuses a secrets file that
grants group access or other access, so the file needs the mode `0600` and the owner root.

```yaml
# /etc/hydrascale/secrets.yaml, mode 0600, owner root
tailnets:
  corp-prod:
    tailscale_oauth_client_id: "..."
    tailscale_oauth_client_secret: "..."
  homelab:
    headscale_api_key: "..."
    headscale_address: "https://headscale.example.com"
```

Write the file with the mode in place:

```bash
sudo install -m 0600 /dev/null /etc/hydrascale/secrets.yaml
sudo "$EDITOR" /etc/hydrascale/secrets.yaml
```

The console writes the same values through `PUT /api/policy/{id}/credentials`.

### A Tailscale credential

The daemon authenticates to the Tailscale API with an OAuth client. Create the client in
the Tailscale admin console:

1. Open `https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/trust-credentials`.
2. Select the button **Credential**.
3. Select **OAuth**.
4. Select the scopes.
5. Select **Generate credential**.

**Warning — the admin console shows the client secret one time only.** Copy the secret
into the secrets file before you leave the page.

**A policy write needs three scopes, not one.** Give the client the scopes:

- `policy_file`
- `devices:posture_attributes`
- `devices:core:read`

The admin console grants `devices:core:read` and `devices:posture_attributes` on its own
when the operator selects the policy file scope at write. The source of the path is
`https://tailscale.com/kb/1215/oauth-clients`, retrieved on 2026-08-05.

`https://tailscale.com/kb/1623/`, "Trust credentials", section `Scopes`, states verbatim:

> policy_file The credential has access to read, validate, and modify the tailnet policy
> file. devices:posture_attributes and devices:core:read are required when using this
> scope. Endpoints from policy_file:read POST /api/v2/tailnet/:tailnet/acl

The Tailscale OpenAPI schema states `OAuth Scope: policy_file.` in the description of
`operationId: setPolicyFile`. Both sources were retrieved on 2026-08-05. A client that
holds `policy_file` alone fails at the write with a permission error that names no cause.

Write the client identifier and the client secret into the secrets file as
`tailscale_oauth_client_id` and `tailscale_oauth_client_secret`. The daemon exchanges them
for an access token at `https://api.tailscale.com/api/v2/oauth/token`, and that token
expires after one hour.

### A Headscale credential

Create an API key on the Headscale host:

```bash
headscale apikeys create --expiration 90d
```

Write the key into the secrets file as `headscale_api_key`, and write the base address of
the control server as `headscale_address`. The daemon sends the key as a bearer token.

Set `policy.mode: "database"` in the Headscale configuration before a policy write. A
server in the file policy mode serves a policy read and refuses a policy write.

### An environment variable overrides a file value

An environment variable overrides the matching file value, and it overrides that value
alone. `<ID>` is the tailnet identifier in upper case, with each dash replaced by an
underscore.

| Variable | Overrides |
|---|---|
| `HYDRASCALE_TS_CLIENT_ID_<ID>` | `tailscale_oauth_client_id` |
| `HYDRASCALE_TS_CLIENT_SECRET_<ID>` | `tailscale_oauth_client_secret` |
| `HYDRASCALE_HS_API_KEY_<ID>` | `headscale_api_key` |

## Host access

Each tailnet stays inside its own namespace by default. The host reaches a peer through a
namespace-scoped command such as `hydrascale exec` or `hydrascale ping`. **Host access**
changes that: the host reaches the peers of every managed tailnet directly.

```bash
# Without host access
sudo hydrascale ping havoc bigboy    # works, but needs the wrapper

# With host access
ping havoc-bigboy
ssh havoc-mars
curl http://havoc-webserver:8080
```

Enable it globally, or per tailnet:

```yaml
# Global: the host reaches every tailnet
host_access: true

# Or per tailnet
tailnets:
  - id: corp-prod
    host_access: true     # the host reaches this tailnet
  - id: personal
    host_access: false    # isolated (default)
```

A local rule still governs the path. A host that reaches a tailnet needs a rule from `host`
to that tailnet.

### How host access works

The daemon does four things on each reconciliation tick of a tailnet that holds host
access:

1. **Host routes.** The daemon adds a host route for the Tailscale address of each peer,
   for IPv4 and for IPv6, through the veth pair of the namespace. The kernel then sends a
   packet to the right namespace. The daemon writes each route into the main table, or into
   the table that `route_table` declares. See "A dedicated route table" below.

2. **Namespace masquerade.** The daemon adds an iptables masquerade rule inside the
   namespace on `tailscale0`. Traffic of the host then carries the Tailscale address of the
   namespace, and `tailscaled` forwards it to the peer.

3. **DNS entries.** The daemon writes `/etc/hosts` entries, so the host resolves a peer by
   name.

4. **A MagicDNS route per tailnet.** The daemon registers the MagicDNS suffix of each
   tailnet, such as `taildf854a.ts.net`, with the DNS forwarder, and points it at the veth
   gateway of that tailnet. A PREROUTING DNAT rule on the veth carries the query to the
   MagicDNS resolver of that namespace at `100.100.100.100`. Several tailnets therefore
   answer MagicDNS queries on one host.

5. **A short name per tailnet.** With `resolver.resolve_aliases` set, the daemon answers
   `<peer>.<alias>.ts.internal` with the tailnet address of that peer. See "Short names
   for a peer" below.

The daemon syncs the routes and the DNS entries on every tick. It removes them at shutdown,
and when host access is disabled.

### Short names for a peer

A MagicDNS name holds the suffix of the control server, such as
`laptop.taildf854a.ts.net`. The operator gives a tailnet a second name with the key
`alias`, and the daemon answers a name under that alias for the same peer:

```yaml
resolver:
  mode: unified
  resolve_aliases: true
host_dns:
  mode: resolved
tailnets:
  - id: Ta1a1a1a1a1CNTRL
    alias: mmo
    host_access: true
```

With this file, `laptop.mmo.ts.internal` resolves to the tailnet address of the peer
`laptop` of that tailnet. The daemon answers an A record and an AAAA record with a time to
live of 30 seconds. It writes no entry in `/etc/hosts` for this name.

ICANN reserved the top level domain `.internal` in 2024 for a private name, therefore a
name under `ts.internal` never collides with a name of the public domain name system.

The name below the alias holds every label that the MagicDNS name holds below the suffix
of the tailnet. A control server that names a peer `a.b.taildf854a.ts.net` therefore gives
`a.b.mmo.ts.internal`, and a nested name keeps its shape.

Three conditions apply, and the daemon answers no alias name when one of them is absent:

- `resolver.resolve_aliases` is `true`.
- `host_dns.mode` is `resolved`. The `hosts` mode writes a file, and a file holds no zone.
- The tailnet holds an `alias` and `host_access: true`.

An alias becomes one DNS label, therefore `LoadConfig` refuses an alias that is not a DNS
label when `resolve_aliases` is set. An alias may hold `_`, and a DNS label may not.
`LoadConfig` also refuses two aliases that differ by case alone, because a domain name
folds case.

The daemon builds the zone as follows:

- The DNS forwarder answers on the host side veth address of each tailnet, on port 53, for
  UDP and for TCP.
- The daemon registers two domains on the veth device of that tailnet: the MagicDNS suffix
  and `<alias>.ts.internal`. A link of systemd-resolved carries one server list for every
  domain that it holds, therefore both domains reach the forwarder, and the forwarder
  routes a MagicDNS query onward to the namespace.
- A query of a name below the alias that the zone does not hold returns NXDOMAIN. The
  forwarder sends no such query to an upstream server.
- The reconciler rebuilds the zone on each tick, therefore a peer that the control server
  adds resolves within one interval of `reconciler.interval`.

The veth address carries the traffic of the namespace as well as the traffic of the host,
so a process inside a namespace can send a packet to this port. The listener therefore
answers the host alone: the host holds one end of every veth pair, and the namespace holds
the other end, which the host does not hold. A query from an address that no interface of
the host holds gets REFUSED, and the daemon logs the refusal with that address. A namespace
reads no name of another tailnet through this port.

Port 53 of the veth address may already belong to another resolver of the host. The daemon
opens the socket before it registers a domain. If the socket does not open, the daemon logs
the failure, registers the MagicDNS suffix alone, and points the link at the namespace side
address, therefore MagicDNS keeps working and the alias zone alone is absent. The daemon
opens the socket again on the next tick.

A name that the key does not cover, such as `laptop.taildf854a.ts.net`, reaches
systemd-resolved on the same path as before. The daemon rewrites no query.

The key is unset by default, and an unset key changes nothing: the veth device carries the
MagicDNS suffix alone, and the link names the namespace side address.

### The overlay mount on /etc

`tailscaled` replaces `/etc/resolv.conf` with a temporary file and a rename whenever its
DNS configuration changes. A bind mount on the single file cannot hold a rename: the new
file lands in the shared `/etc` of the host and replaces the host resolver configuration.

The daemon therefore starts each namespaced `tailscaled` under an overlay mount on `/etc`.
The lower layer is the `/etc` of the host, and the upper layer is a directory per tailnet.
Every write to `/etc`, including that rename, stays inside the namespace, and the process
still reads the `/etc` of the host through the lower layer. The daemon never changes
`/etc/resolv.conf` on the host.

A host that cannot mount OverlayFS fails the start of the namespace, because a namespace
without the overlay mount can replace the resolver configuration of the host. To start such
a namespace anyway, set:

```yaml
dns:
  allow_unprotected: false   # default: false
```

Set `allow_unprotected: true` only on a host where the overlay mount cannot work. The
daemon records the event `dns.unprotected`, and the Overview view of the console shows the
namespace as unprotected.

</p>

<p align="center"><i>The Settings view, which holds the resolver state and the protection state of each namespace.</i></p>

### Accepted subnet routes

When a peer advertises a subnet route and the `tailscaled` of the namespace runs with
`--accept-routes`, the daemon propagates that route to the host. On each tick it reads the
routing table 52 inside the namespace, which is where `tailscaled` installs an accepted
route, and it adds the matching route on the host through the veth gateway.

Pass `--accept-routes` at the login:

```bash
sudo hydrascale tailscale corp-prod -- up --accept-routes
```

The configuration file needs no change. A subnet route appears on the host within one tick
after the login, and the daemon removes it when the tailnet goes away.

### The naming convention

Each peer takes the name `<tailnet-id>-<hostname>`. Two tailnets with a peer of the same
name therefore produce two different names on the host.

| Tailnet | Peer | Name on the host |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| havoc | bigboy | `havoc-bigboy` |
| havoc | mars | `havoc-mars` |
| personal | pixel 8a | `personal-pixel-8a` |
| personal | nas | `personal-nas` |

The daemon lowercases a name and it replaces each space with a dash.

### The two host DNS modes

The key `host_dns.mode` selects the mode.

**`hosts`, the default.** The daemon owns a marked block in `/etc/hosts`:

```
# BEGIN HYDRASCALE MANAGED BLOCK - DO NOT EDIT
100.98.107.70  havoc-mars
fd7a:115c:a1e0::1  havoc-mars
100.73.198.12  havoc-bigboy
# END HYDRASCALE MANAGED BLOCK
```

This mode works on every Linux system. The daemon rewrites the block only when the peer
data changes, and it writes the file atomically. It changes no other entry of `/etc/hosts`.

**`resolved`.** The daemon registers a routing domain with `systemd-resolved` through
`resolvectl`. This mode needs `systemd-resolved`, and it changes no file.

### Teardown

When host access goes away for a tailnet, through a configuration change or a removal, the
daemon removes:

- Every host route of the peers of that tailnet.
- The masquerade rule and the DNS DNAT rule inside the namespace.
- The entries of that tailnet in `/etc/hosts`, or the `systemd-resolved` registration.

A graceful shutdown removes the same state. A graceful shutdown also removes the two
routing policy rules and empties the route table, when `route_table` declares one.

### A dedicated route table

The key `route_table` names the routing table that holds every route the daemon writes on
the host. Leave the key out to keep the main table, which is the behaviour of version 0.9.

53 is the suggested value, because `tailscaled` already uses the table 52 inside each
namespace. The kernel reserves 253, 254 and 255, and the daemon refuses each of them.

```yaml
route_table: 53
```

A route in a table other than the main table reaches no packet until a routing policy rule
sends a lookup to that table. The daemon therefore owns one rule per address family:

```
ip rule add priority 32000 from all lookup 53
ip -6 rule add priority 32000 from all lookup 53
```

The priority 32000 comes after every rule of `tailscaled`, which holds 5210 to 5270, and
before the main table, which the kernel consults at 32766. A host that runs its own
`tailscaled` therefore keeps its precedence, and a route of the daemon still wins over the
main table. The daemon reads the rule list on each tick and it adds no second copy. A
shutdown removes each rule and empties the table.

### Compatibility

- **A standard Linux distribution.** Every feature works, including a MagicDNS name per
  tailnet.
- **Tegra and Jetson**, and any kernel without `xt_connmark`. Every feature works. The DNS
  forwarder and the veth DNAT rule carry a MagicDNS query without `xt_connmark`, so a name
  such as `mars.taildf854a.ts.net` resolves.
- **A host without `systemd-resolved`.** Use the mode `hosts`, which is the default.

## Headscale and a custom control server

The key `control_url` points a tailnet at [Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale)
or at another Tailscale-compatible control server. A self-hosted tailnet therefore runs
beside a tailnet of the Tailscale coordination server.

Set the key per tailnet, or set a global default:

```yaml
version: 2
control_url: "https://headscale.example.com"   # the default for every tailnet

tailnets:
  - id: homelab
    # takes the global control_url

  - id: corp-infra
    control_url: "https://headscale.corp.internal"
    # takes its own Headscale instance

  - id: personal
    # no control_url: the Tailscale coordination server
```

A per-tailnet `control_url` overrides the global default. A tailnet that declares neither
joins the Tailscale coordination server. The URL needs the scheme `https`, unless the host
is a loopback address.

### Log in without an auth key

Without a pre-authentication key, log in after the daemon creates the namespace. Start the
daemon, or run `apply`, then run the login for each tailnet:

```bash
# Start the daemon, which creates the namespaces and starts tailscaled
sudo hydrascale serve &

# Log in to a Headscale tailnet
sudo hydrascale tailscale corp-prod -- up --login-server https://headscale.example.com

# Log in to the Tailscale coordination server
sudo hydrascale tailscale personal -- up
```

The daemon prints the authentication URL. Open it in a browser and approve the device. The
namespace stays up, and the daemon manages it from that point.

### What to check with Headscale

- **The auth key format.** A Headscale auth key has a different form from a Tailscale
  `tskey-auth-*` key. The daemon checks no form and passes the key to `tailscale up` through
  `TS_AUTHKEY`. Use the key type of the control server.

- **MagicDNS.** Host access DNS resolution depends on the DNS configuration of the control
  server. Headscale serves MagicDNS, and its suffix and its behaviour can differ from
  Tailscale. When a name does not resolve, read the Headscale DNS configuration.

- **DERP relays.** Tailscale runs its own global DERP relay network. Headscale uses the same
  relays, its own relays, or both. When two peers cannot connect, read the DERP map of the
  Headscale instance. A direct connection through STUN works without the control server.

## Configuration reference

```yaml

# The subnet of the veth pairs between the host and the namespaces

# The reconciler
reconciler:

```

## Remote access

The daemon serves the control API on the control socket `/var/lib/hydrascale/api.sock`. The
socket is root only by default: the mode is `0600`, and no other account traverses
`/var/lib/hydrascale`. A client that is not root needs group access to the socket. A client
on another machine reaches the socket over an SSH forward, and the SSH account needs the
same group access.

**Warning — membership of `socket_group` is equivalent to root access.** A member of the
group sends a command to the daemon, and the daemon runs as root. The member creates a
namespace, writes a host route, and runs a command as root. Name a group that holds only
trusted operators. The daemon refuses to start when `socket_group` names the root group.

Create the group and add the account to it:

```bash
sudo groupadd hydrascale
sudo usermod -aG hydrascale "$USER"    # log out and in for it to take effect
# set `socket_group: hydrascale` in the config, then restart the daemon
```

`hydrascale init` offers this as a step. With `socket_group` set, the daemon owns the socket
`root:hydrascale 0660` and makes the directory group-traversable. A member of the group then
reaches the control API without root.

**From another machine.** Forward the socket over SSH, then send the request to the
forwarded path. The SSH account must be a member of the socket group on the host:

```bash
ssh -L /tmp/hydrascale.sock:/var/lib/hydrascale/api.sock user@linux-host
curl --unix-socket /tmp/hydrascale.sock http://unix/api/status
```

Forward the console port the same way when the operator wants the console from another
machine:

```bash
ssh -L 9443:127.0.0.1:9443 user@linux-host
```

The console has no authentication, so the SSH forward is the only control on that path.

## Networking

### IP forwarding

The daemon needs `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` on the host, so that traffic from inside a
namespace reaches the internet for the tailnet coordination. Enable it for this boot:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

To keep it across a restart, write `/etc/sysctl.d/99-hydrascale.conf`:

```
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```

### Veth pairs

A veth pair connects each namespace to the host. The interface names come from a short hash
of the tailnet identifier: `vh<hash>` on the host side and `vn<hash>` inside the namespace.
The names therefore stay inside the Linux limit of 15 characters. Each pair takes a `/30`
block from the infra subnet, which defaults to `10.200.0.0/16`.

When `10.200.0.0/16` collides with a route on the network, set `infra_subnet` to a free
range; see [Configuration reference](#configuration-reference). The value must be IPv4 and
at least a `/16`.

### NAT and masquerade

The daemon adds an iptables MASQUERADE rule per namespace, so that outbound traffic of the
namespace goes through the default interface of the host and reaches the internet.

### Docker

Docker sets the policy of the `FORWARD` chain to `DROP`, which stops the traffic between a
namespace and the host. The daemon sends every forwarded packet into `HYDRASCALE-FWD`
before that policy applies, so a local rule that allows the path keeps it open. Version 0.9
wrote an `ACCEPT` rule per namespace into `FORWARD`, and version 1.0 removes those rules at
the start. The operator writes no iptables rule by hand.

The daemon inserts its jump rule at position 1 of `FORWARD` and of `INPUT`. That position is
not stable, because `ts-forward`, `DOCKER-USER`, and `DOCKER-FORWARD` each take position 1
after the daemon starts. The reconciler reads the position on every tick, records the event
`access.jump_displaced` when the position changes, and writes the jump rule again when the
parent chain holds none.

Pass `--config <path>` on any command to name another configuration file. The default is
`/etc/hydrascale/config.yaml`, which the systemd unit also passes.

The namespace-scoped subcommands `exec`, `ping`, `ssh`, and `tailscale` replace a raw
`ip netns exec` line:

```bash
# Before
sudo ip netns exec ns-personal tailscale --socket=/var/lib/hydrascale/state/personal/tailscaled.sock ping Mars

# After
sudo hydrascale ping personal Mars
```

## Agent skills

A skill is one Markdown file that states how a coding agent performs one task. The binary
holds the skill set, so a host needs no checkout of this repository.

Write the skills to the skill directory of the operator:

```bash
hydrascale skills install
```

The command writes each skill to `$HOME/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Run it as the
account that runs the coding agent. Run it without `sudo`. The command keeps a file that
exists. Pass `--force` to write that file. Pass `--dry-run` to print each path and write no
file. `hydrascale skills list` prints the name and the description of each skill.

The binary holds two skills:

- **`hydrascale-setup`** reads the Hydrascale state of a host and reports it. It runs the
  five commands that change no state: `status`, `list`, `diff`, `env`, and `version`. It
  prints every command that changes the host, with the precondition and the risk, and it
  runs none of them.
- **`tailnet-exec`** sends a command into the namespace of one tailnet rather than to the
  host network. It states the five routing forms: `exec`, `tailscale`, `ping`, `ssh`, and
  `wrap`. It reads the tailnet identifier from `hydrascale list`.

`skills/tailnet-exec/SKILL.md` and `skills/hydrascale-setup/SKILL.md` hold the source of
the two skills. A test reads each file, extracts each `hydrascale <command>` string, and
fails when the command tree of the binary holds no such command. A skill therefore states
no command that a later release removed.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `HYDRASCALE_AUTHKEY_<ID>` | Overrides the `auth_key` of the tailnet `<ID>`. `<ID>` is the identifier in upper case, with each dash replaced by an underscore. For the tailnet `corp-prod`, set `HYDRASCALE_AUTHKEY_CORP_PROD=tskey-auth-xxxxx`. |
| `HYDRASCALE_TS_CLIENT_ID_<ID>` | Overrides `tailscale_oauth_client_id` in the secrets file. |
| `HYDRASCALE_TS_CLIENT_SECRET_<ID>` | Overrides `tailscale_oauth_client_secret` in the secrets file. |
| `HYDRASCALE_HS_API_KEY_<ID>` | Overrides `headscale_api_key` in the secrets file. |

## Control API

The daemon serves the JSON API on the control socket `/var/lib/hydrascale/api.sock`, and on
the console listener at `127.0.0.1:9443`. The `tui` command and the `status` command use the
control socket. Every mutating route on the console listener requires the header
`X-Hydrascale-Console: 1`.

| Route | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/status` | GET | The declared state and the live state of every tailnet |
| `/api/events` | GET | The recent events of the reconciler |
| `/api/reconcile` | POST | Run one reconciliation now |
| `/api/tailnet/add` | POST | Add a tailnet to the config and reconcile |
| `/api/tailnet/remove` | POST | Remove a tailnet from the config and reconcile |
| `/api/tailnet/connect` | POST | Clear the error state and reconnect a tailnet |
| `/api/tailnet/disconnect` | POST | Stop the process of a tailnet and keep the config |
| `/api/tailnet/{id}/detail` | GET | The peers, the routes, and the addresses of one tailnet |
| `/api/tailnet/{id}/removal-plan` | GET | What a removal of one tailnet deletes |
| `/api/config` | GET | The current configuration, with every credential removed |
| `/api/config/dns` | POST | Change the resolver configuration |
| `/api/dns` | GET | The resolver state and the DNS protection state per namespace |
| `/api/access` | GET, PUT | Read and write the local rule set |
| `/api/policy` | GET | The control server kind and the write availability per tailnet |
| `/api/policy/{id}` | GET, PUT | Read and write the policy of one tailnet |
| `/api/policy/{id}/validate` | POST | Validate a policy document at the control server |
| `/api/policy/{id}/credentials` | PUT | Write the credential of one tailnet |

Every mutating route validates the whole request body before it changes anything. A failure
returns HTTP 400 and the body `{"error": "<message>"}`.

## Daemon mode

### The systemd unit

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/hydrascale
sudo cp contrib/hydrascale.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now hydrascale
```

The unit at `contrib/hydrascale.service` runs the daemon with ambient capabilities and the
systemd sandbox settings. `hydrascale install` writes the same unit.

### SIGHUP

SIGHUP makes the daemon read the configuration file and reconcile at once, without a wait
for the next tick. Under systemd, `systemctl reload hydrascale` sends the signal.

### A graceful shutdown

SIGINT and SIGTERM cancel the control loop. The daemon stops every tailnet process
concurrently, with a timeout of 30 seconds, and exits.

### Monitoring

```bash
sudo systemctl status hydrascale
sudo journalctl -u hydrascale -f
```

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/architecture.svg" alt="One Linux host. The config file, the reconciler, the console and the DNS forwarder sit on the host. A veth pair joins the host to one network namespace per tailnet, and each namespace runs its own tailscaled and its own tailscale0 interface." width="900">
</p>

The daemon runs one network namespace per tailnet. A veth pair joins each namespace to the
host, and the reconciler, the console, and the DNS forwarder run on the host itself.

The reconciler builds that state from three managers:

```
                      +-----------------------+
                      |    config.yaml        |
                      |  (declared state)     |
                      +-----------+-----------+
                                  |
                                  v
                      +-----------+-----------+
                      |     Reconciler        |
                      |  read the config      |
                      |  read the live host   |
                      |  compute the diff     |
                      |  apply the actions    |
                      +-+--------+----------+-+
                        |        |          |
               +--------+   +---+---+   +--+--------+
               v             v           v
    +----------+--+  +------+------+  +-+----------+
    |  Namespace  |  |   Daemon    |  |  Routing   |
    |  Manager    |  |   Manager   |  |  Manager   |
    | (ip netns)  |  | (tailscaled)|  | (netlink)  |
    +-------------+  +-------------+  +------------+
          |                |                |
          v                v                v
    ns-corp-prod     tailscaled         route sync
    ns-homelab       per namespace      per namespace
```

Each tick of the reconciler:

1. **Read** the declared state from `config.yaml`.
2. **Read** the live state: the namespaces that exist, the processes that are healthy, the
   routes that are installed, and the position of the jump rule.
3. **Compute** the difference, which produces a list of actions.
4. **Apply** the actions in order, and count the failures per tailnet.
5. After three failures in a row, place the tailnet in an error state and skip it until the
   operator resets it.

The reconciler takes a file lock before each tick, so two ticks never change the host at
once.

## Uninstall

`uninstall` stops every tailnet, deletes the namespaces, the veth pairs, the iptables
rules, the host routes, and the DNS entries, then removes the systemd service and
`/var/lib/hydrascale`:

```bash
sudo hydrascale uninstall
```

The command logs each tailnet node out, so no node stays in the tailnet admin console. Pass
`--keep-nodes` to keep them. A plain `uninstall` keeps the binary and `/etc/hydrascale`, so
the command runs again. Pass `--purge` to remove those too, and `--yes` to skip the
confirmation.

## Troubleshooting

**`bind: address in use` for the control socket**
A daemon that crashed left the socket file. Delete it and start again:
```bash
sudo rm /var/lib/hydrascale/api.sock
sudo hydrascale serve
```

**The console does not open**
Read the log for the bind address. The daemon refuses a `console.bind_address` that is not
a loopback host and a port, and it refuses a port that another process holds:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u hydrascale | grep console
```

**A tailnet cannot reach the internet after an upgrade to version 1.0**
The rule set denies the path. Read the rules, and set `access.mode: observe` to see the
paths that the mode `enforce` denies:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u hydrascale | grep hydrascale-would-deny
```

**`hydrascale status` reports `down` and `degraded` after a restart**
A tailnet needs about 20 seconds after a start of the daemon to reach `healthy` and
`running`. Wait 30 seconds and read the state again:
```bash
sleep 30 && sudo hydrascale status
```
A tailnet that still reports `down` after 60 seconds has a real failure. Read the events:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u hydrascale -n 50
```

**A policy write returns a permission error on Tailscale**
The OAuth client holds the scope `policy_file` alone. Add `devices:posture_attributes` and
`devices:core:read`, then write the new client identifier and client secret into the
secrets file.

**A policy write fails on Headscale**
The control server runs the file policy mode, and the answer holds the message
`update is disabled for modes other than 'database'`. Set `policy.mode: "database"` in the
Headscale configuration and restart the control server.

**The daemon refuses the secrets file**
The file grants group access or other access. Set the mode and the owner:
```bash
sudo chown root:root /etc/hydrascale/secrets.yaml
sudo chmod 0600 /etc/hydrascale/secrets.yaml
```

**Traffic of a namespace cannot reach the internet**
IP forwarding is off. Read the value and set it:
```bash
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward          # it must print 1
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1     # set it
```

**The host resolves no public name, and a tailscaled of the host changes the resolver**
A `tailscaled` that the host runs outside Hydrascale, with `accept-dns` on, rewrites
`/etc/resolv.conf` to `100.100.100.100` alone. When that tailnet holds no public upstream,
the host loses public DNS and the resolver of Hydrascale takes the dead upstream. Turn the
DNS management of that process off, and give `/etc/resolv.conf` back to `systemd-resolved`:
```bash
sudo tailscale set --accept-dns=false
sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```
`hydrascale init` detects this in the preflight checks and offers to turn it off.

**`failed to listen on /var/lib/hydrascale/api.sock: no such file or directory`**
The state directory does not exist. `hydrascale init` and `hydrascale install` create it. To
create it by hand:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/hydrascale/state
```

**Docker stops the traffic of a namespace**
The daemon writes its jump rule at position 1 of `FORWARD`, but another rule can come
first. Read the chain:
```bash
sudo iptables -L FORWARD -v
```
Look for a `DROP` rule before the jump rule of Hydrascale, and remove it or move it.

**The infra subnet collides with a route**
When `10.200.0.0/16` overlaps a route on the host, the veth setup fails or the traffic goes
to the wrong place. Read the routes:
```bash
ip route | grep 10.200
```
On a match, set `infra_subnet` to a free range:
```yaml
infra_subnet: "10.201.0.0/16"
```
Then restart the daemon. It deletes the namespaces and builds them again with the new
addresses.

**A host route does not carry traffic**
A route in a table other than the main table reaches no packet until a routing policy rule
sends a lookup to that table. Read the rules and the table:
```bash
ip rule
ip -6 rule
ip route show table 53
ip -6 route show table 53
```
The rule list holds `32000: from all lookup 53` for IPv4 and for IPv6, and the table holds
one route per peer. When the rule is absent, read the log for `hostaccess`. When another
rule of the operator already holds the priority 32000, the daemon adds none and it states
the table that the rule looks up.

**`name not a valid ifname`**
An older version used the whole tailnet identifier as the interface name, which passes the
Linux limit of 15 characters. Install the current release, which uses the hash names
`vh<hash>` and `vn<hash>`.

**MagicDNS returns SERVFAIL for a tailnet name**
First read the log for `refresh_dns` after `start_daemon` on that tailnet:
```bash
journalctl -u hydrascale | grep -E 'start_daemon|refresh_dns'
```
When `refresh_dns` is absent or timed out, `tailscaled` never reached
`BackendState=Running`. The cause is a bad auth key, no network route, or a control server
that does not answer. Read `sudo hydrascale tailscale <id> -- status`. When `refresh_dns`
ran and a query still returns SERVFAIL, read the resolv.conf of the namespace; it must hold
real upstreams and never `100.100.100.100`:
```bash
cat /etc/netns/ns-<id>/resolv.conf
```
As a last step, restart the service with `sudo systemctl restart hydrascale`. The reconciler
runs the DNS refresh again on the next tick.
